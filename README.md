# Pyrated
Plagiarism is a growing concern in the current education system and even in academia. A significant number of university level courses depend on programming assignments for evaluation of the students. However, it has been found that many students plagiarize other studentsâ€™ codes to receive good grades and/or for other related benefits. With the growing number of students in the education sector, it is now almost impossible for the instructors to manually verify each one of the code files for plagiarism. Hence, an automated tool is required which can identify and mark such cases with reasonable accuracy.

This field of plag detection has already been explored by many academicians and they have proposed different approaches to go about making such a tool. In this project, we aim to study some of these approaches and implement them in Python and finally, benchmark their performance.
